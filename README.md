# Node.js & React Web App on AWS

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern web application using infrastructure as code principles. It showcases a production-ready deployment architecture that leverages containerization and automation to ensure reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

## Business Value
The application serves as a user information management system, allowing organizations to securely collect and store user registration data. Key benefits include:

- **Automated Deployment**: Entire infrastructure can be deployed consistently and reliably using Ansible automation
- **Containerized Architecture**: Microservices-based design using Docker ensures component isolation and scalability
- **Cloud-Native**: Built for AWS cloud infrastructure, demonstrating modern cloud architecture principles
- **Security-Focused**: Implements secure communication between services and protected database access
- **Maintainable Design**: Clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database layers

## Key Technical Achievements
- Implemented complete Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution using Ansible
- Designed and deployed containerized microservices architecture
- Created automated deployment pipelines for all application components
- Established secure communication patterns between services
- Implemented database persistence with proper security measures

This project demonstrates expertise in modern DevOps practices, cloud architecture, containerization, and automation, making it an excellent example of production-grade application deployment.
